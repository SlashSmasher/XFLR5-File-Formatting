# XFLR5-File-Formatting
This is an application to convert exported polars from XFLR5 to Excel, automatically.
To use this application, we must, therefore, give some instructions:
1) To export polars from XFLR5, we have to go to "Polars" in the top menu, click on "Export all", and to "text format". Make sure they are in a .csv format.
2) Then we will have to choose the directory where we want to save them. Note it, as it will be important later.
3) Once this is done, we open the application
4) The first input we have to provide is the number of calculations. There, we have to put the number of analyses we have done or the number of files we have exported
5) Then we will be asked to input the directory of the files, we can do this by going to the folder where we have saved the files and copying the directory by clicking the bar at the top. IMPORTANT, this is NOT the directory of the file, after we put as input the "C:\Users...", we have to add the name of the file with its extension, for example, "C:\Users...\test.csv"
6) We will have to repeat step 5 as many times as the number of calculations.
7) Once done this, we will be asked the directory where we want to save the file. This is ONLY the directory, so we only have to put the "C:\Users..." without any file name.
8) Then we will have to put the name of the Excel file, this is, again, only the name of the file, WITHOUT any extensions
9) Then the app will close, and we will find the Excel file in the folder we have chosen.

NOTE: If the app crashes during the process, it may be due to an Incorrect Format on the input. Check for any spaces at either the end or the beginning. If you can't find any errors, please let me know. For other inquiries, message me as well.
NOTE: I am using XFLR5 v6.57, and sometimes it does not export the polars in a .csv, it save them as a .txt. 

Thank you for using this app ;)
