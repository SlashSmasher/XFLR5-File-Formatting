# XFLR5-File-Formatting
This is an aplication to convert exported polars from XFLR5 to Excel, automatically.

To use this aplication, we must, therefore, give some instructions:
1) To export polars form XFLR5, we have to go to "Polars" in the top menu, click on "Export all", and to "text format"
2) Then we will have to choose the directory where we want to save them. Note it, as it will be important later.
3) Once this is done, we open the aplication
4) The first input we have to provide is the number of calculations. There, we have to put the number of analisys we have done, or the number of files we have exported
5) The we will be asked to input the directory of the files, we can do this by going to thw foler where we have saved the files, and copying the directory by clicking the bar at the top. IMPORTANT, this is NOT the directory of the file, after we put as input the "C:\Users\...", we have to add the name of the file with its extension, fo example "C:\Users\...\test.csv"
6) We will have to repeat step 5 as many times as the number of calculations.
7) Once done this, we will be asked the directory where we want to save the file. This is ONLY the directory, so we only have to put the "C:\Users\..." without any file name.
8) Then we will have to put the name of the Excel file, this is, again, only the name of the file, WITHOUT any extensions
9) Then the app will close, and we will find the Excel file in the foler we chosed.

NOTE: If the app crashes during the process, it may be due to Incorrect Format on the input. Check of any spaces at either the end or the begining. Of you can't find any error, please let me know. For other inquiries, mesage me as well.

Thank you for using this app ;)
